# Portfolio progetti
This GitHub portfolio gather some of my school and work projects.  
They're done with **R** and **Phyton**  
  
## [Anomaly detection](https://github.com/Monofascia/anomaly-detection)  
:heavy_check_mark: **R**  
* Work project about error detections in annual reporting. 
* Only R script due to NDA.
  
## [Excercises on Web Scriaping](https://github.com/Monofascia/webscraping)
:heavy_check_mark: **R**  
* Self-taught excersises for work projects. In the link above there are some examples used to show to clients  
  
## [Project 8: Classification](https://github.com/Monofascia/classification)  
:heavy_check_mark: **R**  
* A tool to calculate the probability of fire in Algerian forest.
* Machine learning models used are: LDA, SVM linear and radial, KNN, random forest, rpart  
  
## [Project 7: Spatial analysis](https://github.com/Monofascia/spatial-analysis)  
:heavy_check_mark: **R**  
* A study about O3 pollution in the USA (O3 pollution.pdf).
* Kriging method 
  
## [Project 6: Regularized regression](https://github.com/Monofascia/regularized-regressions)  
:heavy_check_mark: **R**  
* This project is developed on three different problems:  
  * Created a tool to predict a prostate cancer by using RIDGE and LASSO regressions (PROBLEMA 1);  
  * Created a fake dataset to understand how RIDGE and LASSO works (PROBLEMA 2);  
  * With another fake dataset is developed a Shooting Alghoritm to see how LASSO works (PROBLEMA 3)  
* It's a full-immersion and deep-understanding of Ridge and Lasso alghoritm functions.  
     
## [Project 5: Neural Network](https://github.com/Monofascia/NeuralNetwork)  
:snake: **PYTHON**  
* This was my first time with Python and my first Neural Network  
* For a better view go to this link: [Google COLAB](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cAMY32NpwR8oDdzj51sQlRflLWdI6feO?usp=sharing)  
* It's everything explained there so just enjoy the reading!  
  
## [Project 4: Principal component analysis](https://github.com/Monofascia/pca)  
:heavy_check_mark: **R**  
* This is the last project for first semester Data science course. Here it's executed a really simple PCA for economics data.  
* Actually I've learned new graphics and new libraries for a better visual info and anlysis.  
* This project was useful to learn basic analytic skills for following cluster models (in other courses)  
  
## [Project 3: Spatial regression](https://github.com/Monofascia/reg_dati_spaziali)  
:heavy_check_mark: **R**  
* Tested the influence of neighbourhood in real estate value  
* Moran test, Geary, Getis-Ord, jarque-bera..  
* Spatial autoregressive model (SAM)   
* Spatial lag model (SLM)  
* Spatial error model (SEM)  
* Spatial durbin model (SDM)  
* SARAR  
* Spatial durbin error model (SDEM)  
* Spatial lag x (SLX)  
* General nesting model (GNS)  
  
## [Project 2: Logistic regression](https://github.com/Monofascia/logistic)  
:heavy_check_mark: **R**  
* Created a model to estimate a purchase by social media ads  
* Dummy analysis on gender 
* Confusion matrix  
  
## [Project 1: Linear regression models](https://github.com/Monofascia/linear-regression)
:heavy_check_mark: **R** (it was my first time)   
* Created a model to estimate revenue for movies  
* Dataset got from Kaggle
* Selected the best variables for prediction and tested OLS with Jarque Bera, Breusch Pagan and Durbin Watson
